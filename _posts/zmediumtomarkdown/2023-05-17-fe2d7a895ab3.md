### Exploring Design Patterns in Go

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems that help developers build software that is maintainable, extensible, and scalable\. In this article, we will explore some popular design patterns in Go: Builder, Decorator, Factory Method, Fan\-in\-out, and Singleton\.
### **1\. Builder Pattern**

The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations\. It provides a step\-by\-step approach to building objects\. Let’s see an example of the Builder pattern in Go:
```go
type User struct {
	Name   string
	Role   string
	Salary int
}

type UserBuilder struct {
	User
}

func (ub *UserBuilder) setName(name string) *UserBuilder {
	ub.User.Name = name
	return ub
}

func (ub *UserBuilder) setRole(role string) *UserBuilder {
	ub.User.Role = role
	return ub
}

func (ub *UserBuilder) setSalary(sal int) *UserBuilder {
	ub.User.Salary = sal
	return ub
}

func (ub *UserBuilder) Build() User {
	return ub.User
}

func main() {
	ub := &UserBuilder{}
	user := ub.
		setName("John Doe").
		setRole("Admin").
		setSalary(5000).
		Build()
}
```

In the above example, UserBuilder provides methods to set different attributes of the user and a Build method to create the final User object\.
### 2\. Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern allows you to wrap existing functionality and append or prepend your own custom functionality on top\. It enables adding behavior to objects dynamically at runtime\. Let’s see an example of the Decorator pattern in Go:
```go
/*Decorators essentially allow you to wrap existing functionality and append or prepend
your own custom functionality on top.*/

func mainFun() {
	fmt.Println("main func")
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func additionalFun(a func()) {
	fmt.Printf("Starting function execution: %s\n", time.Now())
	a()
	fmt.Printf("ending function execution: %s\n", time.Now())
}
func main() {
	additionalFun(mainFun)
}
```

In this example, we have a mainFun function representing the main functionality, and the additionalFun function acts as a decorator, adding additional behavior before and after executing the mainFun function by accepting it as an argument\.
### 3\. Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern allows the creation of objects without specifying their exact types and delegates the instantiation to the factory\. It provides a way to decouple the abstraction and implementation of object creation and enables flexibility in creating different types of objects\.
```go
type Engine interface{
	Start()
	Stop()
}
type car struct{

}
func(c car) Start(){
	fmt.Println("car start")
}
func(c car) Stop(){
	fmt.Println("car stop")
}

type train struct{

}
func(c train) Start(){
	fmt.Println("train start")
}
func(c train) Stop(){
	fmt.Println("train stop")
}

func starting( e Engine){
	e.Start()
}

func stopping( e Engine){
	e.Stop()
}

func GetEngine(engineType string) Engine {
	switch engineType {
	case "car":
		return car{}
	case "train":
		return train{}
	default:
		fmt.Println("type undefined")
		return nil
	}
}

func main(){
	engine := GetEngine("car")

	starting(engine)
	stopping(engine)
	engine1 := GetEngine("train")
	starting(engine1)
	stopping(engine1)
}
```

In this example, we have a factory method called GetEngine that returns Car or Train objects based on the specified engineType\. The main function showcases the usage of the factory method by creating engine objects and invoking their Start\( \) and Stop\( \) methods\.
### 4\. Fan\-In and Fan\-Out Patterns
1. **Fan\-In Pattern**


In the Fan\-In pattern, multiple input channels are combined into a single output channel\. The inputs can come from different sources, and the Fan\-In pattern allows you to merge and process the data from these sources concurrently\. It aggregates data from multiple channels into a single channel, enabling centralized processing\. Here’s an example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func generator(start, end int) <-chan int {
	ch := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for i := start; i <= end; i++ {
			ch <- i
		}
		close(ch)
	}()
	return ch
}

func squareWorker(in <-chan int, out chan<- int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	for num := range in {
		result := num * num // Square the input
		out <- result
	}
}

func main() {
	numbers := generator(1, 5)
	squaredNumbers := make(chan int)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(3)

	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		go squareWorker(numbers, squaredNumbers, &wg)
	}

	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(squaredNumbers)
	}()

	for res := range squaredNumbers {
		fmt.Println(res)
	}
}
```

In this Fan\-In example, we have a `generator` function that returns a channel that produces numbers in a specified range\.

We have multiple `squareWorker` goroutines that receive numbers from the `numbers` channel, square each number, and send the squared result to the `squaredNumbers` channel\. Each worker goroutine is synchronized using a `sync.WaitGroup` \.

The main goroutine uses the `generator` function to create a `numbers` channel with numbers from 1 to 5\. It then launches multiple `squareWorker` goroutines to process the numbers concurrently\.

The main goroutine waits for the workers to finish processing by calling `wg.Wait()` \. It then closes the `squaredNumbers` channel and receives the squared numbers from the channel, printing them\.

**2\. Fan\-out Pattern**

In the Fan\-Out pattern, a single input channel is divided and distributed among multiple worker goroutines\. Each worker receives a portion of the workload and operates on it independently\. The Fan\-Out pattern allows you to parallelize the processing of data by dividing the workload and assigning it to multiple workers\.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func producer(ch chan<- int) {
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		ch <- i
	}
	close(ch)
}

func worker(in <-chan int, out chan<- int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	for num := range in {
		result := num * 2 // Process the input
		out <- result
	}
}

func main() {
	input := make(chan int)
	output := make(chan int)

	go producer(input)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	workerCount := 3
	wg.Add(workerCount)

	for i := 0; i < workerCount; i++ {
		go worker(input, output, &wg)
	}

	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(output)
	}()

	for res := range output {
		fmt.Println(res)
	}
}
```

In this Fan\-Out example, we have a `producer` goroutine that sends numbers from 1 to 5 to the `input` channel and then close it\.

We also have multiple `worker` goroutines that receive numbers from the `input` channel, perform some processing \(in this case, multiply the number by 2\), and send the result to the `output` channel\. Each worker is synchronized using a `sync.WaitGroup` \.

The main goroutine waits for the workers to finish processing by calling `wg.Wait()` \. It then closes the `output` channel and receives the processed results from the `output` channel, printing them\.
### 5\. Singelton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application\. It provides a global point of access to this instance, allowing shared access to its resources\. Let’s explore different implementations of the Singleton pattern in Go:
#### 1\. Not Thread Safe \(NTS\)

The first implementation we’ll look at is the Non\-Thread Safe \(NTS\) approach\. While simple, it’s not suitable for concurrent scenarios:
```go

type singleton struct {
	val int
}

var instance *singleton

/*1) Not thread safe(NTS)*/
func GetSingletonNTS() *singleton {
	if instance == nil {
		instance = &singleton{}
	}
	return instance
}
```

In this implementation, the `GetSingletonNTS` function lazily initializes the `instance` variable\. However, if multiple goroutines access `GetSingletonNTS` simultaneously and `instance` is still `nil` , they may end up creating separate instances\.
#### 2\. Mutex Lock

To introduce thread safety, we can use a `sync.Mutex` to control access to the initialization code:
```go
type singleton struct {
	val int
}

var instance *singleton
var lock sync.Mutex

func GetSingletonML() *singleton {
	lock.Lock()
	defer lock.Unlock()

	if instance == nil {
		instance = &singleton{}
	}
	return instance
}
```

In this implementation, we use a `sync.Mutex` named `lock` to synchronize access to the `instance` initialization\. While it ensures thread safety, it introduces a potential bottleneck when multiple goroutines need to acquire the lock\.
#### 3\. Check\-Lock\-Check

We can improve performance by minimizing the number of lock acquisitions using a double\-checked locking approach:
```go
type singleton struct {
	val int
}

var instance *singleton
var lock sync.Mutex

func GetSingletonCLC() *singleton {
	if instance == nil {
		lock.Lock()
		defer lock.Unlock()

		if instance == nil {
			instance = &singleton{}
		}
	}
	return instance
}
```

In this implementation, we first perform a quick check on `instance` without acquiring the lock\. If `instance` is still `nil` , we acquire the lock and perform a second check before creating the instance\. This approach reduces the number of lock acquisitions but is prone to subtle bugs in certain scenarios\.
#### 4\. Using sync\.Once

The recommended way to implement the Singleton pattern in Go is to use the `sync.Once` package's `Do` function:
```go
type singleton struct {
	val int
}

var instance *singleton
var once sync.Once

func GetSingletonOnceDo() *singleton {
	once.Do(func() {
		instance = &singleton{}
	})
	return instance
}
```

In this implementation, the `GetSingletonOnceDo` function ensures that the initialization code inside the `once.Do` block is executed only once, regardless of the number of calls to `GetSingletonOnceDo` \. It provides thread safety and better performance compared to the other implementations\.
