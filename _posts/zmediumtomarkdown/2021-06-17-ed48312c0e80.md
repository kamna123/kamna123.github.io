### Think, Stick and just go

I just finished watching the **Skater Girl** movie and have penned down my thoughts\.

First of all, it’s really an inspiring movie\. It focuses on the story of a poor village girl, who initially had no idea what to do in her life and soon introduced to the world of skateboarding by a foreigner\. But she faces a rough road ahead but never gives up and follows her passion\.

It really reminded me of my journey\. Being a small\-town girl, I faced resistance at every point in my life\. But I never gave up\. Even now, a lot of people do not appreciate my work, being a part of a male\-dominated industry\.

I too feel the scarcity of women in the tech world\. To date in my career, I have been to startups where I was the only female developer\. It might be due to the gender stereotype and lack of a talent pool\. A very few women prefer or rather allowed to explore technology\-related fields\. We really need to change our mindset\.

_“Women bring a lot to a tech company — different perspectives and skillsets, tech companies with more women are more successful and it’s a hot industry to be in, good\-paying jobs with lots of diversity in focus \(dev, cybersecurity, ops, etc\. \) and opportunity\. Don’t allow yourself to be intimidated by a room full of men\.”_

Last but not least, I just wanted to say — Give wings to your dreams

Few lines from the movie :

_“I have touched the pinnacle,_

_I have realized my worth,_

_Now that my feet have opened up as wings , why shouldn’t I weave,_

_The dreams my eyes have seen, My complicated life I have to resolve,_

_The trust I have in me has to manifest,_

_I will touch the sky, immersed in joy,_

_I have taken flight\. I know sun is gonna shine on me”_
