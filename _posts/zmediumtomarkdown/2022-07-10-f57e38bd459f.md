### Dear Myself

**Dear Maya** , I stumbled on this movie while randomly scrolling, with a few expectations\.

It is really an engrossing movie, based on the life of Maya Devi, a lonely and old woman who has lost all hopes to reclaim a life that is always there to begin\. Then two school girls decided to add color to her life by sending fake love letters\. Little did they know how it is going to impact their lives\.

Just a few notes to myself after watching this movie :

_Dear Myself_ , Whatever destiny has in store for you, always say yes to life\. Because you have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow\.

_Dear Myself_ , Be courageous enough to try something out of your comfort zone Don’t be afraid, instead enjoy the process and lessons you learn along the way\.

_Dear Myself_ , Always try to live in the present moment\. Trying to change it will lead only to frustration and exhaustion\. Acceptance is the key to a happy life\. Acceptance of an unpleasant situation does not mean giving up on your goals\. We are just trying to accept the situation which is beyond our control\.

_Dear Myself,_ Don’t fall into the trap of sacrificing your self\-esteem for affection and acceptance from others\.

That’s easier said than done\. Practice makes a man perfect\. Personally, I feel meditation helps a lot in achieving this\.
