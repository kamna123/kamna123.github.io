#### Introduction

In concurrent programming, ensuring data integrity and preventing race conditions is crucial\. In Go, the `sync.Mutex` type provides a simple and effective way to achieve mutual exclusion and control concurrent access to shared resources\. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of mutexes, understand how to use them in Go, and discuss their internals, and their role in solving race conditions\.
#### What is a Mutex and how it solves race conditions:

A mutex, short for mutual exclusion, is used to protect shared resources from simultaneous access by multiple goroutines\. It ensures that only one goroutine can access a critical section of code at a time\. Race conditions occur when multiple goroutines access and modify shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable and erroneous behavior\. Mutexes prevent race conditions by allowing only one goroutine to acquire the lock and access the shared resource, while other goroutines wait until the lock is released\.

Mutexes are data structures provided by the standard [sync](https://pkg.go.dev/sync/){:target="_blank"} package\.
#### Understanding Mutex Internals

Let’s try to understand how mutex prevents race conditions\. It’s time to delve into the internals of mutex\.

Internally, the `sync.Mutex` type in Go utilizes low\-level atomic operations provided by the underlying processor architecture\. These atomic operations ensure that the mutex operations themselves are thread\-safe and efficient\.

To understand the role of low\-level atomic operations, let’s take a closer look at the implementation of the `sync.Mutex` type\. While the exact implementation details may vary depending on the target platform, we can examine a simplified version that highlights the essential elements:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var counter = 0

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	counter++
	wg.Done()
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	expectedCounter := 1000

	for i := 0; i < expectedCounter; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go increment(&wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Expected Counter:", expectedCounter)
	fmt.Println("Actual Counter:", counter)
	// Check for race condition
	if expectedCounter != counter {
		fmt.Println("Race condition detected!")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("No race condition detected.")
	}
}
```

In the simplified implementation above, the `Mutex` struct includes a `state` variable, which represents the lock's state, and a `sema` variable, which is a semaphore used for blocking and waking up goroutines\.

The `Lock()` method attempts to acquire the lock by using the `atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32()` function\. This function atomically compares the `state` variable's value with 0 and swaps it with 1 if they are equal\. If the swap is successful, the lock is acquired without blocking\. Otherwise, the `Lock()` method calls `runtime_SemacquireMutex()` to wait for the lock to become available\.

The `Unlock()` method releases the lock by using the `atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32()` function again\. It compares the `state` variable's value with 1 and swaps it with 0 if they are equal\. If the swap is successful, indicating that the lock was held, the `Unlock()` method calls `runtime_SemreleaseMutex()` to wake up any waiting goroutine\.

The use of atomic operations ensures that the lock’s state is updated atomically, without interference from other goroutines\. This atomicity guarantees thread safety and eliminates the need for additional locks or synchronization mechanisms\.
#### How to prevent race conditions

In Go, the `sync` package provides the `Mutex` type, which includes two main methods: `Lock()` and `Unlock()` \.

To understand how a mutex solves race conditions, let’s consider an example without using a mutex:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var counter = 0

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	counter++
	wg.Done()
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	expectedCounter := 1000

	for i := 0; i < expectedCounter; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go increment(&wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Expected Counter:", expectedCounter)
	fmt.Println("Actual Counter:", counter)
	// Check for race condition
	if expectedCounter != counter {
		fmt.Println("Race condition detected!")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("No race condition detected.")
	}
}
```

Below is the output :

Output

Here multiple goroutines are simultaneously reading and updating the value of the counter without any proper synchronization\.

Race condition

We need to use the `sync.Mutex` type to prevent multiple goroutines from accessing `counter` at the same time:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var counter = 0
var mutex sync.Mutex

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	mutex.Lock()
	counter++
	mutex.Unlock()
	wg.Done()
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	expectedCounter := 1000

	for i := 0; i < expectedCounter; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go increment(&wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Expected Counter:", expectedCounter)
	fmt.Println("Actual Counter:", counter)

	// Check for race condition
	if expectedCounter != counter {
		fmt.Println("Race condition detected!")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("No race condition detected.")
	}
}
```

Below is the output:

No race conditions
#### Where Not to Use Mutex
1. **High Contention** : If many goroutines are frequently trying for the same lock, the performance of mutexes can degrade\. In such cases, consider using alternative synchronization primitives like `sync.RWMutex` or channel\-based communication patterns\.
2. **Deadlock Risks** : Improper use of mutexes can lead to deadlocks, where goroutines end up waiting indefinitely for a lock to be released\. Avoid complex nesting of locks or forgetting to unlock the mutex\.

#### Using `defer` with `Unlock()`

It is very easy to miss unlocking the mutex\.


> **Whenever you call the `Lock` method, you must ensure that `Unlock` is eventually called, otherwise any goroutine trying to acquire the same lock will be blocked forever\.** 




```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var mutex sync.Mutex

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		mutex.Lock() // will wait here indefinitely if Goroutine 2 acquires lock first

		fmt.Println("Goroutine 1 acquired the lock")
		n := 2
		if n%2 == 0 {
			return
		}
		mutex.Unlock() // mutex is never unlocked

	}()
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		mutex.Lock() // will wait here indefinitely if Goroutine 1 acquires lock first

		fmt.Println("Goroutine 2 acquired the lock")

		n := 2
		if n%2 == 0 {
			return
		}
		mutex.Unlock() // mutex is never unlocked

	}()
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Main goroutine completed")
}
```

In the above example, if either goroutine1 or goroutine2 acquires the lock, the unlocked goroutine will wait for the lock indefinitely\. Here the if condition is always true and it will never unlock the mutex\.


![output](/assets/5f41199085b9/1*7jA33Wr-Nt08GfDSQce82g.png)

output

We can use defer here to prevent such kind of scenarios\. Without defer, forgetting to manually release the lock before returning from a function can lead to deadlocks, where a goroutine may be blocked indefinitely\.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var mutex sync.Mutex

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		mutex.Lock()
		defer mutex.Unlock()
		fmt.Println("Goroutine 1 acquired the lock")
		n := 2
		if n%2 == 0 {
			return
		}

	}()
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		mutex.Lock()
		defer mutex.Unlock()
		fmt.Println("Goroutine 2 acquired the lock")

		n := 2
		if n%2 == 0 {
			return
		}

	}()
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Main goroutine completed")
}
```


![output](/assets/5f41199085b9/1*Hhq2fAE8_tXL65mLYqY_bw.png)

output

The `defer` statement in Go allows us to postpone the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns\. By deferring the `Unlock()` method immediately after acquiring the lock, we ensure that the mutex will always be released, even if an error occurs or a panic is triggered\.
#### Conclusion

Mutexes play a crucial role in concurrent programming to ensure proper synchronization and prevent race conditions\. By using the `sync.Mutex` type in Go, developers can protect shared resources and control access to critical sections of code\.
